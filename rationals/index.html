    This web page contains short description and implementation of my infinite complete binary
    search tree of rational numbers. This tree, generally speaking, may be useful in solving the
    following problems:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Finding the exact zero of a monotone function if the zero belongs to the set of rational
        numbers, or finding its approximation by a rational number if it is not contained in the set
        of rational numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encoding of rational numbers. The path in the tree from the root to any rational number
        can be represented as a finite sequence of zeros and ones. This sequence can be used to
        compactly store a rational number in computer memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reconstructing a fraction from a floating-point number, that is, finding a fraction that is
        close to to a given floating point number, but not equal to it.
        For example the number 1/3 cannot be expressed exactly as a floating point number, but after
        approximating it with some X, it will be possible to get back 1/3 from number X by searching
        for X in the tree.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The tree has the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each vertex of the tree contains a rational number, and each rational number is contained in
        the tree exactly once. Thus there is a bijection between the vertices of the tree and the
        rational numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tree is a binary search tree, that is, for each vertex it is true that its corresponding
        rational number is greater than the numbers corresponding to its left descendants and
        less than the numbers corresponding to its right descendants.
        This is one of the properties that distinguishes my tree from Calkin-Wilf tree.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a rational number, the depth at which its corresponding vertex will be located, is
        directly proportional to the maximum of the logarithm of the numerator and the logarithm of
        the denominator of this number and does not depend on the sign.
        This property is the key difference between my tree and the The Stern-Brocot tree in which
        the depth depends linearly on the numerator and the denominator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using this tree, it is possible to map a finite binary code to each rational number,
        which will indicate the path to the corresponding vertex in the tree.
        For example, the number -3/4 corresponds to the code 010.
      </li>
      <li>
        Symmetries of the binary representation of vertices.
        If the number X corresponds to the binary code
        X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>...X<sub>n</sub>,
        then the following properties are fulfilled for the tree:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The code Y<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>...Y<sub>n</sub>
            corresponds to number -X.
          </li>
          <li>
            The code X<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>...Y<sub>n</sub>.
            corresponds to number 1/X
          </li>
          <li>
            [For numbers from 0 to 1]
            The code X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>...Y<sub>n</sub>.
            corresponds to 1-X
          </li>
          <li>
            [For numbers from -1 to 0]
            The code X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>3</sub>...Y<sub>n</sub>.
            corresponds to -1-X
          </li>
        </ol>
        where Y<sub>i</sub> equals to one if and only if X<sub>i</sub>=0. <br>
      </li>
